# HTML Tagless Web Page (Script-Only DOM Construction)

A creative and experimental project by **Funtime3Freddy3** that builds an entire web page *purely from JavaScript* â€” without a single HTML tag in the document body!

Feel free to use, learn from, and expand it. Great for JS learners, challenge seekers, and code artists who enjoy pushing boundaries.

## Features

- Fully renders a website using only JavaScript and the DOM API
- No `<body>`, `<div>`, or other HTML tags needed in the source
- Dynamic head construction (title, favicon, styles, bootstrap)
- Footer, header, button, and multiple paragraphs all via JS
